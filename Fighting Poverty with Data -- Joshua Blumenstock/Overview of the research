üìò Overview of the Paper
Joshua Blumenstock‚Äôs ‚ÄúFighting Poverty with Data‚Äù (published in Science, 2015) explores how machine learning and mobile phone data can be used to predict and map 
poverty in developing countries, especially where traditional household surveys are expensive and infrequent.

KEY POINTS FROM THE PAPER
The primary challenge in developing countries is the scarcity of reliable, spatially disaggregated data.
Mobile phones are a key source of "big data" in developing regions due to their ubiquity.
The study merged a phone survey of 856 individuals with call records of 1.5 million users.
A composite wealth index was created from survey responses as the prediction target.
The modeling process had two steps: feature engineering and feature selection via elastic net.
The model predicted individual wealth with a cross-validated correlation of r = 0.68.
The model's output was used to create high-resolution maps of wealth at the micro-regional level.
District-level predictions from phone data strongly correlated (r = 0.916) with ground-truth DHS data.
A key application is providing low-cost, timely interim statistics between national surveys.
The main future challenges are privacy protection and addressing mobile operators' concerns.
