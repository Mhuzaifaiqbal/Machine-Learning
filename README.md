This repository contains multiple ML projects designed to showcase my machine learning journey and deepen my concepts through hands-on practice.
Each project focuses on different classification tasks and integrates a variety of models and techniques from scikit-learn and other popular libraries like XGBoost,Meta Prophet and imbalanced-learn.
Explore discrete features of machine learning including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation metrics, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning,and more.
This collection is perfect for learners looking to strengthen their practical understanding of machine learning workflows and algorithms.
