This project applies multiple machine learning models to predict loan approval status (Approved or Not Approved) using a small loan dataset. 
The goal is to preprocess the data properly, handle class imbalance with SMOTE, scale features, and compare model performances with 
cross-validation and final hold-out evaluation.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Imputed missing categorical values (Gender, Married, Dependents, Self_Employed, Credit_History, Loan_Amount_Term) with mode (most frequent).

Imputed missing numerical LoanAmount with mean.

Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.

Dropped Loan_ID column (unique identifier, not useful for prediction).

Converted all columns to numeric types (handling any bad values).

Visualized feature distributions and outliers using boxplots and histograms.

 Handling Imbalance & Scaling
Classes are moderately imbalanced (approximate ratio 2:1).

Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to oversample minority class during cross-validation.

Applied RobustScaler for feature scaling to reduce the impact of outliers.

Scaling and oversampling performed inside the pipeline to avoid data leakage.

 Models Used
