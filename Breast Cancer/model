This project implements and evaluates several machine learning models to classify breast cancer tumors as Malignant (M) or Benign (B) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset.
The goal is to compare multiple classification algorithms and observe the impact of feature scaling and cross-validation.
Preprocess the dataset: clean missing values, drop highly correlated features.

Handle potential class imbalance using StratifiedShuffleSplit.

Use both RobustScaler and StandardScaler for scaling.

Evaluate the following models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier (only one not sensitive to feature scaling)

Compare models using:

Cross-validation accuracy

Classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score)
